Call createdecal.js with any of these files to be used as the base
If you want to use a custom body, you may replace body.png

If you want to use the painted decals, rename "decalnames - including painted.json" to "decalnames.json" You will need to manually go to the finished mydecalname.json file and make sure that the painted decals are linked to painted decal SkinIDs that you own hand have equipped. Otherwise the decals will not be painted as expected.

If you don't want to use one of the locations, set shouldDraw to false for any of the locations in drawlocations.json
